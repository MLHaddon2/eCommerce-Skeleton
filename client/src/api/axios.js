// FIXED:
// Added withCredentials: true — without this the browser silently drops all
// Set-Cookie headers from cross-origin responses (client on :3000, server on :5001).
// This flag tells the browser to include cookies on every request and accept
// cookies from every response, which is required for the httpOnly session cookie
// set by the server to actually be stored and sent back.
